- 👋 Hi, I’m @sdriku
- 👀 I’m interested in programming of course, I also practice tennis and football, I play video games once in a while, and I like reading too (these days, about history). And beers (Czech and Belgian).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java Script and how to use different Front End libraries. I have been building websites for a few years now, but I´d like to take it to the next level by becoming proficient with JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, where I could contribute to the front-end part in any useful way.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Trhough my website, [Codelice] (https://www.codelice.com)
