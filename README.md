- 👋 Hi, I’m @sdriku
- 👀 I’m interested in programming of course, also sports like tennis and football, video games once in a while, and I like reading too (these days, about history).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java Script and how to use different Front End libraries. I have been building websites for a few years now, but I´d like to take it to the next level by becoming proficient with JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects, where I could contribute to the front-end part amongst other things.
- 📫 How to reach me ? Well, very soon, through my personal website once I publish it :)
